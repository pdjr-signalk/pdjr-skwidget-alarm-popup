# signalk-libalarmclient

Web component for signalk-alarm.

This library provides a popup component for use in Signal K webapps
that reacts to alarm notifications issued by
[__signalk-alarm__](https://github.com/preeve9534/signalk-alarm#readme).

To use the widget, download the library to a location accessible from
your webapp and include the JavaScript and CSS components by adding
something like this at the top of your main webapp file (usually
'index.html' or 'index.js').
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="lib/signalk-alarm-widget/AlarmWidget.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="lib/signalk-alarm-widget/AlarmWidget.css">
```
